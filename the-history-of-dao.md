# The history of DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one of the most innovative and exciting developments in the blockchain space. These autonomous entities are designed to be completely decentralized, transparent, and self-governing, with their decisions made via smart contracts and community consensus. But where did the concept of DAOs come from? Let's take a look at the history of DAOs, from their early beginnings to their current state of development.

### Early Beginnings

The idea of a decentralized autonomous organization can be traced back to the Cypherpunk movement in the 1980s and 1990s. The Cypherpunks were a group of individuals who believed in the power of cryptography to create decentralized systems that would protect privacy and freedom. They were the first to propose the idea of a digital currency, and they also explored the potential of decentralized governance systems.

In the early 2000s, Nick Szabo, a prominent cryptographer and blockchain pioneer, proposed the idea of "smart contracts." Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code. They can be programmed to automatically trigger specific actions, based on certain conditions.

Szabo's idea of smart contracts provided the foundation for the development of DAOs. In 2013, Daniel Larimer, a software developer and entrepreneur, proposed the idea of a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC). The concept was similar to that of a traditional corporation, but with one crucial difference: it would be governed entirely by code and community consensus.

### The Rise of DAOs

The first DAO was created in April 2016, called "The DAO." It was built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it raised more than $150 million in funds from investors. The DAO was designed to be a venture capital fund, with investors receiving tokens that would represent their ownership of the organization. These tokens could then be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.

However, The DAO was not without its flaws. In June 2016, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the code, stealing approximately $50 million worth of Ether (Ethereum's cryptocurrency). This incident highlighted the challenges of developing a truly decentralized organization, as well as the importance of security in blockchain-based systems.

After The DAO hack, the Ethereum community decided to hard fork the blockchain, creating a new chain that would allow them to recover the stolen funds. However, this decision was controversial, with many in the blockchain community believing that the immutability of the blockchain was paramount.

Despite this setback, the concept of DAOs continued to evolve. In 2017, a new type of DAO called Aragon was launched. Aragon was designed to be a platform for creating and managing DAOs, providing a range of tools for developers and organizations to build decentralized entities. Aragon also launched its own token, ANT, which would be used for voting and decision-making within the organization.

In the same year, the Moloch DAO was launched. Moloch was designed to be a community-driven DAO, focused on funding Ethereum development. Members of the organization would pool their funds together and then vote on proposals for funding specific projects.

### Recent Developments

In the years since the launch of The DAO, many other DAOs have emerged, focused on a range of different areas, from social impact to finance to gaming. The DAO landscape has become increasingly diverse and innovative, with new DAOs launching every year.

One of the most significant developments in the DAO space has been the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. These protocols are designed to provide financial services, such as lending and borrowing, in a decentralized and transparent way. Many DeFi protocols are governed by DAOs, with community members voting on decisions and proposals.

Today, DAOs are seen as an important development in the evolution of blockchain technology. They offer a new model for decentralized organization that is transparent, efficient, and highly resistant to censorship and corruption. DAOs have the potential to transform a wide range of industries, including finance, governance, and even art and culture.

In conclusion, DAOs represent an exciting development in the world of blockchain technology. While the first DAO, The DAO, suffered from some high-profile problems, the concept of DAOs has continued to evolve and mature in the years since. As blockchain technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more and more DAOs being launched, and the potential for this new model of decentralized organization to revolutionize the way that we work and live.
